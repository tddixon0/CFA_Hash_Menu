# CFA_Menu is under construction for dirty code

#Desired topics to finish:
#Cart function
Have a running count of all items want to purchase, and add up value when asked.
#Interface

#Reward System
"you earned 50 points from this purchase"
#Employee login
Make a simple if else and input a custom, hard coded 6/8digit pin. If pin = ID continue; else restart.
Have somewhere to ask if you have discount.

Are you employee? Yes, then ask for ID number. No continue with order taking.

##TONIGHT
Make Hashing work
Cart (Add all the items up to print out a final total) 
GUI

#Ideas to solve
Maybe just have a menu item paired with a number (Asian restaurant, EX: E4 or D3 or even just a number like 56)

#COMPLETED
Employee Login using an ID

#CRUNCH TIME
SQL for menu and prices
Have a "cart function" that sums up prices selected
Return in interface
GUI in Java
